How can you help Sunita Sharma (65+ years old) to live a healthier and better life?

I provided is a simple example of a medication reminder app. It is just a starting point, and you can extend it to add additional features and functionality.

For example, you could add the following features:

The ability to set reminders for medications
The ability to track when medications have been taken
The ability to integrate with GPS tracking to send alerts if a medication dose is missed
The ability to sync with a user's calendar to avoid scheduling medication reminders during busy times
The ability to provide educational resources on medications and healthy living tips
The ability to integrate with other healthcare providers, such as a user's doctor and pharmacist
